						<p>Use this page to tell site visitors about yourself. You can fill this area with text, images or anything you have embed code for (maps, videos, etc.). Use our editor to add headlines, lists, links and more. There are links in a column to the right that can be used for links to social accounts or other sites/pages.</p>
						<p><img src="images/image_thumb.jpg" class="right" width="200"></p>
						<p>Images can be aligned to the left or right by using the image editor. Simply bring up the editor by clicking on the image > edit icon ( <i class="barley-icon-edit"></i> ) and type either "left" or "right" in the class field. You can also change the size of an image and the title here as well. An existing image, such as the one to the right, can be replaced or removed. Replacing an image will cause the new image to be cropped to the dimensions of the original. This can come in handy for certain situations. To place an image on the page with different dimensions, simply remove the original and add the new one.</p>
