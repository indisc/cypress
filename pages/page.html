						<p>You can add as many pages to your site as you'd like and fill each page with text, images and other embed-able elements (maps, videos, etc.). Use our editor to <a href="http://getbarley.com/">add links to your text</a>, or use <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italics</em> plus headlines, lists and more. To pull up the Barley editor, either select some text or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+e when your cursor is in an editable region. </p>
						<img src="images/image_thumb.jpg" class="right" width="220"><p>Images can be aligned to the left or right by using the image editor. Simply bring up the image editor by clicking on the image > edit icon ( <i class="barley-icon-edit"></i> ) and type either "left" or "right" in the class field. You can also change the size of an image and the title here as well. An existing image, such as the one to the right, can be replaced or removed. Replacing an image will cause the new image to be cropped to the dimensions of the original. This can come in handy for certain situations. To place an image on the page with different dimensions, simply remove the original and add the new one.</p>
